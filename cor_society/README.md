## Testing console commands (vanilla command console)

Paste these into the game's daapi command console to jump straight to a rank (for
testing the Senate & Politics system):

```js
// Become Dictator immediately:
daapi.invokeMethod({ event: "/cor_society/engine", method: "debugMakeDictator" })

// Become Emperor (Imperator) immediately:
daapi.invokeMethod({ event: "/cor_society/engine", method: "debugMakeEmperor" })
```

Both open the Senate & Politics screen afterwards. The Emperor command also marks
you as having been Dictator (the first Emperor must pass through the dictatorship).
